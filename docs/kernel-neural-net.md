Here’s a step-by-step plan you can feed to your AI-agent (terminal or browser) when you’re ready to make your kernel “neural first”—meaning the neural net is a built-in, evolving, actually-working agent for low-level OS tasks like sysadmin, security, and troubleshooting. This is written to be clear and chunked for AI-driven coding sessions:

Neural-First Kernel Extension: Action Plan for AI Assistant
1. Design the Neural Agent “Core”
Write a minimal feedforward neural network module in Rust (or your kernel language) from scratch:

Single hidden layer Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

Use compact, CPU-safe ops (no external crates at first).

Allow configurable input, hidden, output sizes.

2. Embed the Neural Agent in the Kernel
Expose a kernel struct holding weights, state, and simple “inference” function.

Add kernel syscalls/commands:

neuralctl infer <input_values>, outputting vector of scores (in shell, UART, or host API).

neuralctl status to print weights, last inputs/outputs.

Add basic safeguard: every “agent call” is bounded in compute, never blocks the OS.

3. Bootstrapping Use Cases
Start with simple “reasoner” tasks—examples:

Alert: “Is this network traffic suspicious?” (inputs = network stats/features)

Decide: “Do I restart a failed service?”

Classify: “Did a user command succeed, fail, or need fixing?”

4. Start Primitive Training/Update Methods
Kernel command: neuralctl update <weight_values> or neuralctl reset

(Later) Add optional shell command:

neuralctl teach <input> <target_output> — one-step weight adjust (e.g., simple gradient)

5. Shell Integration
Wrap with a natural language shell command, e.g.:

ask-ai "<plain English request or sysadmin question>"

(Initially: map to input features, call neural agent, print output)

6. Feedback Loop & Logging
Log every neural agent inference and its context (inputs/outputs).

Log if agent was used for a real kernel action, what changed, and user feedback (did it help?).

7. Expansion Plan
As you demo basic agent ability:

Add more inputs, output labels, and more complex tiny nets per subsystem (network, scheduler, filesystem, security).

Enable periodic or “on feedback” re-training:

Kernel command: neuralctl retrain <logfile>.

Document use cases, expand kernel hooks, and always expose simple CLI or host command for non-coders.

Quick Example Session for the Agent
text
neuralctl infer 0.8 0.1 0.9     # Run basic inference; get scores.
ask-ai "Why is the network slow?"   # Map plain English to features, call agent, get hint/next steps.
neuralctl teach 0.8 0.1 0.9 1   # Update: for input, expect 'alert = yes'
neuralctl status                # Show agent configuration/state.
This plan is modular, easy to code/test, and will let your OS “reason” and learn from day one. You can start with the tiniest net and scale as you go, always keeping everything testable and friendlier for non-coders.
Feed this directly to your AI terminal agent after completing current tasks—you’ll be at the bleeding edge of self-learning, agent-driven kernels!
